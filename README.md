# Java-Numbered_Square
The Numbered_Square program prints an n Ã— n square pattern based on user input. Each row contains the same number, starting from 1 and increasing in each row. It uses a Scanner to take input, a nested loop to print numbers, and System.out.print() for output formatting. The outer loop controls rows, and the inner loop prints numbers.
